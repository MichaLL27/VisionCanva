Update the VisionAI creation flow logic to a TWO-STEP AI PROCESS instead of direct image generation.

Do NOT remove existing screens or UI components.
Only change the FLOW, DATA HANDLING, and add ONE NEW INTERMEDIATE SCREEN.

CURRENT FLOW:
Focus Areas → Vision Text → Style → AI Image Generation → Result

NEW REQUIRED FLOW:
Focus Areas → Vision Text → Style → 
STEP 1: AI PROMPT GENERATION →
USER PREVIEW & CONFIRM PROMPT →
STEP 2: AI IMAGE GENERATION →
Result Screen

STEP 1: AI PROMPT GENERATION (NEW LOGIC)

After the user completes:
- Focus Areas
- Vision Text
- Style

Instead of sending directly to image generation:

1. Send the user inputs to OpenAI TEXT MODEL (ChatGPT).
2. The model must generate:
   - A highly detailed IMAGE PROMPT for a vision board
   - Based on:
     - The user's life goals
     - Their written dream description
     - The selected visual style

The output must be a clean, cinematic, professional image prompt in English (even if the UI is Hebrew).

NEW SCREEN: “AI PROMPT PREVIEW”

Add a new screen between loading and image result:

Title (Hebrew default):
- “ה־AI יצר פרומפט ללוח החזון שלך”

Subtitle:
- “כך הבינה המלאכותית מתארת את לוח החזון שלך לפני יצירת התמונה”

UI ELEMENTS:
- Large readonly text area (card style) that displays:
  - The full generated image prompt
- Buttons:
  - Primary: “אישור ויצירת תמונה”
  - Secondary: “צרו פרומפט חדש”

Behavior:
- Clicking “אישור ויצירת תמונה” sends the generated PROMPT to the IMAGE GENERATION MODEL.
- Clicking “צרו פרומפט חדש” re-runs STEP 1 (text→prompt) only.

---

STEP 2: AI IMAGE GENERATION (UPDATED LOGIC)

Once the user approves the prompt:

1. Send the generated PROMPT to the OpenAI IMAGE MODEL.
2. Generate:
   - One main vision board image (or multiple variations if configured).
3. Then continue to:
   - Existing “Manifesting your vision…” loading screen
   - Existing Result screen with:
     - Vision board image
     - Generate variation (this reuses ONLY the image generation step with the same prompt)
     - Download PDF
     - Send to Print

---

DATA STRUCTURE UPDATE (INTERNAL LOGIC ONLY)

Store these separately:
- userVisionText (raw dream description)
- aiGeneratedPrompt (final cinematic image prompt)
- generatedImageURL (final board image)

The image model must NEVER receive the raw user text directly — ONLY the AI-generated prompt.

---

IMPORTANT UI RULES

- The user must NEVER write image prompts manually.
- The user only writes:
  - Goals
  - Dream description
- The system (ChatGPT) always converts that into a professional image prompt.
- The user is allowed to:
  - Approve the prompt
  - Regenerate the prompt
  - But NOT edit it manually.

---

VISUAL CONSISTENCY

- The new “Prompt Preview” screen must:
  - Use the same rounded card UI
  - Same background
  - Same typography
  - Same RTL behavior in Hebrew
- The progress indicator at the top must now show:
  Step 1: Details
  Step 2: Prompt
  Step 3: Image

---

FINAL RESULT

The VisionAI creation experience must now feel like:
1. The user describes their dream.
2. The AI translates it into a perfect visual command.
3. Then the AI turns that command into a real vision board image.

This makes the process:
✅ Smarter
✅ More professional
✅ Much higher image quality
✅ Easier to debug & improve
✅ Better for future prompt optimization
