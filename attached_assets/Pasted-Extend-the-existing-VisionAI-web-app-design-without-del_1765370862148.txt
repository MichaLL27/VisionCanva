Extend the existing “VisionAI” web app design without deleting or radically changing any current screens.

Keep:
- The current landing page with hero, CTA “Start Now”
- The “Focus Areas” screen
- The “Your Vision” text screen
- The “Choose a Style” screen
- The AI loading / “Manifesting your vision…” screen
- The result screen with the generated vision board, “Generate Variation”, “Send to Print”, and “Download as PDF”
- The existing color palette (purple primary), typography, rounded cards, and mobile-first layout

Now ADD the following new screens and components, matching the current visual style:

1) GLOBAL HEADER & FOOTER
- Keep the existing top bar as the main header but add:
  - Left: “VisionAI” logo / wordmark
  - Right: links: “How it works”, “Pricing”, “My Account”, and a “Sign In” button when logged out.
- Add a global footer component that appears on all pages, with a light background and small text:
  - Columns:
    - Product: “How it works”, “Pricing”, “FAQ”
    - Company: “About”, “Contact”, “Support”
    - Legal: “Terms of Use”, “Privacy Policy”, “Refund Policy”, “AI Disclaimer”
    - Social: icons for Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest
  - Bottom line: “© VisionAI – See your future on the wall.”
- Make sure the footer is simple, clean, and optimized for mobile (stacked layout).

2) “SEND TO PRINT” FLOW (after the existing result screen)
Reuse the existing “Next Steps” card on the result screen, but when the user clicks “Send to Print”, open a new flow with multiple steps:

SCREEN: Print Options
- Title: “Choose your print size”

  - A1 (59.4 x 84.1 cm) – “Statement wall”
  - Canvas 40 x 60 cm – “Framed-style canvas”
  - Canvas 60 x 90 cm – “Large premium canvas”
- Each card includes:

Design this admin screen in the same visual language but it can look slightly more utilitarian.

8) LEGAL PAGES (BASIC LAYOUTS)
Create basic layouts for:
- Terms of Use

Each:

Overall design rules:

- Keep everything mobile-first and responsive.
- Reuse the current colors, typography, and card style.
- Use clear, friendly language and spacious layout so the app feels premium and calming.
