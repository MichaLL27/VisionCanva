Update the entire VisionAI website UI color system to match the visual color palette of the newly uploaded vision board images (luxury sunset, ocean blues, warm gold, sand, nature green, soft shadows).

Do NOT change layout, spacing, typography, components, or behavior.
Only update the COLOR THEME across the entire app.

Extract the dominant visual palette conceptually from the current example vision boards, and apply it as a new global design system.
